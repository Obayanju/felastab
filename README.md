# Felastab (In Progress)

Searching a large codebase can get messy. Looking for one function in a codebase with hundreds of files? Looking for an example for how an API is supposed to be used? Finding references to everywhere a certain function is used? Looking for a web based tool to help with that? Felastab is an application to do just that.
